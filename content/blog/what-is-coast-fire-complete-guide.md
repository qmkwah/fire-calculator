Coast FIRE is one of the most achievable paths to financial independence, yet it's often misunderstood. Unlike traditional FIRE that requires aggressive saving until you can retire immediately, Coast FIRE lets you **stop saving entirely** while still reaching financial independence by your desired retirement age.

## What is Coast FIRE?

Coast FIRE means you've saved enough money that **compound growth alone** will carry you to full financial independence by your target retirement age, even if you never save another dollar.

Here's the key insight: once you reach your Coast FIRE number, you can:
- Stop aggressive saving entirely
- Take lower-paying jobs you enjoy more
- Start a passion project or business
- Travel or take extended breaks
- Live more freely knowing retirement is handled

## Coast FIRE vs Traditional FIRE

**Traditional FIRE:**
- Save 50-70% of income until you have 25x annual expenses
- Retire immediately when you hit your number
- Typically takes 10-15 years of aggressive saving

**Coast FIRE:**
- Save aggressively for a shorter period (5-10 years)
- Then coast with minimal/no saving for decades
- Same final retirement outcome with more lifestyle flexibility

## How to Calculate Your Coast FIRE Number

The Coast FIRE formula is:

**Coast FIRE Number = FIRE Number ÷ (1 + return rate)^years to retirement**

### Example Calculation

Let's say you're 30 years old and want to retire at 60 with $80,000 annual income:

1. **FIRE Number:** $80,000 ÷ 0.04 = $2,000,000 (using 4% rule)
2. **Years to retirement:** 60 - 30 = 30 years
3. **Expected return:** 7% annually
4. **Coast FIRE Number:** $2,000,000 ÷ (1.07)^30 = **$262,000**

This means if you save $262,000 by age 30, you can stop saving entirely and still have $2 million at 60!

## Real Coast FIRE Examples

### Example 1: The Teacher
- **Sarah, age 25, teacher making $45,000**
- Wants to retire at 62 with $60,000 annual income
- Coast FIRE number: $195,000
- If she saves aggressively for 8 years, she can coast for the remaining 29 years

### Example 2: The Tech Worker  
- **Mike, age 35, software engineer making $120,000**
- Wants to retire at 55 with $100,000 annual income
- Coast FIRE number: $633,000
- Already has $400,000 saved, needs $233,000 more

### Example 3: The Late Starter
- **Lisa, age 45, nurse making $70,000**
- Wants to retire at 67 with $70,000 annual income
- Coast FIRE number: $1,170,000
- Needs aggressive saving but can still achieve Coast FIRE

## Coast FIRE Strategies

### 1. Front-Load Your Savings
The earlier you reach Coast FIRE, the more freedom you have. Consider:
- Living on one income if you're a couple
- House hacking to reduce expenses
- Side hustles to accelerate savings
- Geographic arbitrage (move somewhere cheaper)

### 2. Optimize Your Investment Returns
Coast FIRE depends heavily on compound growth:
- **Stock market index funds** (historical 10% returns)
- **Target date funds** for automatic allocation
- **Roth IRAs** for tax-free growth
- **401(k) matching** is free money

### 3. Choose Your Coast FIRE Lifestyle
Once you hit Coast FIRE, you have options:
- **Barista FIRE:** Work part-time for health insurance
- **Geoarbitrage:** Move to lower cost of living area  
- **Passion projects:** Start that business you always wanted
- **Career pivot:** Take that lower-paying dream job

## Common Coast FIRE Mistakes

### 1. Underestimating Inflation
- Use real returns (7% vs 10% nominal)
- Plan for healthcare cost increases
- Consider lifestyle inflation over decades

### 2. Ignoring Taxes
- Traditional 401(k) withdrawals are taxable
- Consider Roth conversions during low-income years
- Plan for tax-efficient withdrawal strategies

### 3. Not Having a Post-Coast Plan
- What will you do after reaching Coast FIRE?
- How will you handle health insurance?
- Will you have enough social stimulation?
